/*Abstract Base class => It means a base class which is only for making a derived classes from it and in 
  main function only derived's class member calls. Abstract base class can't create its object. Abstract 
  base class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function in its body. The classes which are 
  inheriting the base class must need to override the virtual function of the abstract class otherwise 
  compiler will throw an error.

  Pure virtual function => Pure virtual function is a function that doesnâ€™t perform any operation and the
  function is declared by assigning the value 0 to it. If we make a base class function a pure virtual
  function so this base class pure virtual function bound to make a same name function in derived class and 
  compiler call derived class function.
